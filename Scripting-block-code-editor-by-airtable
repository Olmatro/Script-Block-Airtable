Scripting block code editor
The scripting block includes a robust, built-in code editor.  You can switch to the edit mode by clicking the "Edit" button in the upper left of the block.  When you are done writing code, you can exit by clicking the "Finish editing" button.  In edit mode, the block will expand to fit the current window (note the image below shows a very small window to best show the switching to edit mode).
